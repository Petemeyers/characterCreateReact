RPG Character Creation Game
This project is an RPG character creation game inspired by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness RPG system by Palladium Books (1994 rules). The game allows users to generate a character from various species, roll attributes, assign bonus rolls for highlighted attributes, and determine the character's age based on a 100-sided die roll.

Features
Species Selection: Players can choose from a variety of species, each with unique attribute dice rolls (e.g., humans, dwarfs, elves, trolls, etc.).
Attribute Rolling: Each species has its own set of dice for rolling attributes such as IQ, ME, MA, PS, PP, PE, PB, and SPD.
Bonus Roll: After initial attribute rolling, players can receive a bonus roll (1d6) for attributes that are highlighted in green, signifying exceptional rolls. This bonus applies only to 2d6 and 3d6 rolls, not 4d6 or 5d6.
Age Calculation: Once attributes are chosen, a character's age is rolled based on their species using a 100-sided die, and different age brackets apply for different species.
Character Naming: After finalizing the character attributes and age, users are prompted to name their character.
Finish Character: Once the character is finished, no further modifications can be made.
How to Play
Select a species from the dropdown menu.
Roll attributes using the "Roll Attributes" button. You can regenerate the attributes as many times as you like before finalizing.
After youâ€™re satisfied with the attributes, press "Choose Attributes" to lock in the rolls and proceed.
After locking in the attributes, press the "Roll Bonus" button to roll additional dice for any green-highlighted attributes.
Once all attributes and bonuses are applied, click "Finish Character" to finalize the creation process and provide your character with a name.
